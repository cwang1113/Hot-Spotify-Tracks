# ORIE 4741 Final Project: Spotify Music Analysis

*By Clay Wang and Medhavi Gandhi*

**Question**

Our goal is to analyze musical data and identify how “hot” a song will be given certain features. We plan on answering the following questions:

* Will a song be popular based on characteristics of the song such as genre, length, etc.?

* Does year influence what features are important in determining “hotness”

**Dataset**

We have a dataset that consists of the top songs from 2016, 2017, and 2018. A sample of the features associated with a song is in the image below

Our data was collected from the Spotify Web API and from the “spotipy” Python package.

We plan on using various combinations of the features above in order to predict whether or not a song is popular.

**Project Value**

A lot of artists and record labels consider the “hotness” of their songs important, and by identifying characteristics of songs that have been chart-toppers, record labels will be able to see what traits make a song popular, and be able to choose songs to release and artists to work with to maximize “hotness” of their songs.
